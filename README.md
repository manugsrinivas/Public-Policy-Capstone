## 📘 Project Overview

This project examines how all 50 U.S. states set, track, and achieve spending goals for Historically Underutilized Businesses (HUBs). Conducted for **NCGrowth**, an economic development institute within UNC Kenan-Flagler, the project evaluates procurement transparency, HUB/DBE program structures, and performance against established goals.

Deliverables include:

- A comprehensive **policy analysis report**  
- A structured **dataset** with HUB spending and performance metrics  
- Interactive visualizations (heatmaps, spending charts)  
- Policy recommendations to strengthen state HUB programs

## 📊 Data & Methodology

### Data Sources
- State procurement dashboards  
- DOT and certification program reports  
- Budget and legislative publications  
- Federal DBE documentation  
- Direct state agency outreach  

### Key Variables
- State HUB goal (%)  
- Actual HUB spending  
- Race-conscious vs. race-neutral frameworks

## 📍 Key Findings

### Characteristics of High-Performing States
- Clear, publicly available spending data  
- Robust race-conscious goal methodology  
- Training and outreach for HUB firms  
- Decentralized procurement authority  
- Efficient certification processes  

### Persistent Challenges
- Inconsistent reporting and missing data  
- Racial disparities in contract allocation  
- Race-neutral programs underperform  
- Structural barriers for Hispanic- and Native-owned businesses  

### Policy Recommendations
1. Expand transparency and annual reporting  
2. Adopt or strengthen race-conscious methodologies  
3. Increase HUB training and networking  
4. Decentralize contracting authority where appropriate  
5. Improve certification timelines through tech upgrades
